My name is Yash. I work as a Technical Artist, and I really enjoy everything related to tech. I'm a huge advocate for open-source stuff and I love making pipelines and optimizing my work because I love the <em>thought</em> of being lazy and if it takes me 10 hours of work to save 5 minutes everyday, you bet I'm going to spend that time figuring out how to get it done and then forget about it.</p>
<p>I have a degree in 3D Animation and have worked as a creative for some advertising agencies, but have since pivoted to being a Technical Artist at an animation studio.</p>
<h2>So what exactly is this?</h2>
<p>Well you see, since I tend to forget about stuff, I figured I should maybe write about how I get stuff done so that maybe when I'm debugging things a few months down the line, I can refer back to this and not spend another couple of hours re-learning what I have promptly forgotten. This will also serve as an open-source guide on various different how-to's which I hope can be useful for people getting into tech, but without a tech background.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, I do not have a tech background, but I like messing around so a lot of what I'm doing here is what works for me; YMMV. </p>
<p>There is no theme to this blog as such, it's really just an open diary to record my progress and documenting my ideas and implementations towards making my life easier. Maybe it will double up as a portfolio some day but that's still a long way to go.</p>
<p><a href="/files/pdfs/CV_YASHSrivastava.pdf" target="_blank">Here's my resume</a> for you to look at what I've done professionally thus far.</p>
<p>Although I'm still trying to figure out how to set up comments on my website, if you have any ideas or just wanna say hi, you can reach out to me on my socials or just send me an <a href="mailto:qvesera@proton.me?subject=Hello!✉️" target="_blank">email!</a></p>
