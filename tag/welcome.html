</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>My name is Yash Srivastava and this is my first attempt at building a portfolio/blog website; This is also an attempt to journal my journey (that sounds a <em>little odd</em>; log my progress perhaps?) and make notes along the way, so that I can come back to it later.</p>

It's pretty exciting considering that this is the first time I'm actually pushing out something that is so publicly visible for everyone to see. I'm still learning how to work with markdown and it's a little too much all at once so I'm slowly making my way up. So thank you for joining me while I work towards something that is exciting for me!
<br><br>
If you have reached here organically, it must be very odd and I'm sorry about that. You must be wondering who is this guy? Why am I here? What is going on? Do you think God stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?</p>

Well, to answer some of your questions, <a href="/pages/about-me">this</a> is who I am and what I do. As for God, if they do feel afraid of what they have created, that opens a bigger topic of free will; because only when there is free will among their creations is there a reason to fear the consequences. So in return, I ask you. Do you think we have free will or is everything happening just the way it has been planned by the universe? Are you here because <strong>you</strong> want to or is it because it was going to happen inevitably? Are you really in control of your life?

<h2>Anyways....</h2>
<p>It took <strong><em>a LOT</em></strong> of debugging to get here, especially considering how I have spent several days scratching my head trying to figure out why GitHub hates me (They don't, I was using an email forwarding service and they don't like that so they marked my account as spam LOL)! BUT we are back on track and here we go!!!</p>
<p>I will be talking about stuff that I do (mostly related to Unreal Engine, tools, pipeline ideas, home servers and other exciting open-source news, maybe some side projects and cool stuff I'm exploring on the side). It feels a little ambitious and that's okay. We try our hardest and hope for the best, I guess.</p>
<p>On that note, thanks for sticking around for my long rambling and I hope you have a great day! (I really do need to learn some proper blogging etiquette, but for now this is what you get)</p>
<p>Oh also! Happy Valentines Day to anyone celebrating! (That's a thing people say, right?)</p>                    </article>
